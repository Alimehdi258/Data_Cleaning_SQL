## Introduction
The Nashville Housing Database is a valuable resource for analyzing the real estate market in Nashville. However, like many real-world datasets, it often contains missing values, inconsistencies, and other data quality issues. This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure its usability and reliability for further analysis.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can use the project as follows:
1. Place the Nashville Housing Database file (`nashville_housing.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the data cleaning script: `python clean_data.py`
4. The cleaned dataset will be saved as `cleaned_nashville_housing.csv` in the project directory.

## Data Cleaning Steps
The data cleaning script (`clean_data.py`) performs the following steps on the Nashville Housing Database:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset are identified and handled appropriately. This may involve imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation.
2. **Data Type Conversion**: The script ensures that each column in the dataset has the correct data type. For example, numeric columns are converted to the appropriate numeric type, and date columns are parsed correctly.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records are identified and removed from the dataset to prevent bias or duplication of information in subsequent analyses.
4. **Dealing with Inconsistent Data**: Inconsistent data entries, such as misspelled or inconsistent values, are corrected or standardized to ensure data integrity and consistency.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Outliers in numeric columns are identified and handled using appropriate techniques, such as removing or adjusting extreme values.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features may be derived from existing columns to provide more informative data for analysis. For example, extracting the year or month from a date column.
7. **Data Validation**: The cleaned dataset is validated to ensure that it meets the necessary quality standards and requirements for analysis.
